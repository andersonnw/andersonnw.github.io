        <q>Jackself is staying in<br>
            today, like a tool in a toolbox,<br>
            to try to just be<br>
            high in the lovely lofts<br>
            of Lamanby<br>
            he stands at a cracked<br>
            window watching the gulls<br>
            flash and snap, like washing on a line<br>
            <br>
            in the pale heat<br>
            the wormy heartwood floorboards<br>
            swell and creak<br>

            he stands for an age<br>
            not for a dark age,<br>
            not for an ice age or an iron age, but for a<br>
            pollen age, when bees<br>
            browsed the workshops<br>
            of wildflowers for powder<br>
            of light, and the cables<br>
            of a spider's web were dusted with gold<br>
        by the unreceptacled breeze </q>
