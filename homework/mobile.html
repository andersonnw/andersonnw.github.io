            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <!-- ***********************************************
Outline what you were asked to do and how well you completed the assignment.
You may want to review the questions you were asked to consider.  If you need more than one paragraph just add another by adding the opening and closing paragraph tags...like this: <p>new paragraph text here</p>
************************************************* -->
            <p>Looking for things on a mobile isn't too much of a change for me. With this Millenial generation we love the convenience Mobile phones give us. </p>

            <h2>Questions to consider:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Can you still see what you want to see?</li>
                <li>Can you find what you're looking for?</li>
                <li>Can you do what you want to do?</li>
                <li>Any frustrations?</li>
                <li>Anything work better on the small screen?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Findings</h2>
            <!-- for each question give your general experience, and then give a specific example of a site that you though did a good or bad job with this.  Do not use the same site for all examples! -->
            <h3>Can you still see what you want to see?</h3>
            <p>Overall yes. You can find anything you could with the desktop browser. A great example is Google. I can see pretty much the same information on my phone as I can a desktop version.</p>
            <h3>Can you find what you're looking for?</h3>
            <p>You can usually find everything you need. However, there are sites where you can't. The I-learn mobile website is almost useless.
            About all you can do is see a confusing list of assignments. Not even sure that you can tell if you turned it in or not. </p>
            <h3>Can you do what you want to do?</h3>
            <p> With very few exceptions I can do just about anything I need to be able to.
            A great exmaple with this is Youtube. I can get good qualtiy, if not better qualtiiy, videos on my phone. I was shocked to see videos on my friends iPhone 7 and how much clearer it was compared to my own computer.</p>
            <h3>Any frustrations?</h3>
            <p>For the most part I had Minimal Fustration. Most mobile sites I visited were well designed and easy to use.However, the biggest pain will be I-learn.
            like I said the mobile site for this was nearly useless.</p>
            <h3>Anything work better on the small screen?</h3>
            <p>I noticed overall that social media works a lot better on a small screen. Any ads would be less noticable and posts are easier to read.
            this is especially true with Reddit. With the Desktop reddit it the posts are super small. On the mobile the posts fit the screen.</p>
            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>I learned just about ever site has made a mobile site. I never realised just how wide-spread it currently is.
            This just goes to show how technology is leaning more and more to convenience and accessibity with high quality. </p>

            <h2>List of sites</h2>
            <!-- list out the sites you used as examples above.  The href="" portion is where you will put the URL to the site.  In between the <a></a> is where you will put the clickable text the use will see.  The first link to Google is given as an example...you should change it to one of your links. -->
